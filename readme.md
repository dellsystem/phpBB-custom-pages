What is this?
-------------

A CMS-like custom pages MOD for phpBB. Currently being developed for a site I am working on. Will be released under the GPL when it's done.

What features will it have?
---------------------------

It won't be overly complex - think the flatpages app for Django. You can add pages and specify the URI you want them to appear it. Flat links are recommended but if you don't have access to .htaccess then it will still work (it just won't be as pretty). In list format:

*   Customisable template files to display the page
*   A customisable menu, whose links can be edited from the ACP
*   You can add a (theoretically) unlimited number of custom pages
*   You can edit the content of the pages through the ACP
*   Permissions will be supported, so you can control who can edit/delete/add pages

ONLY ADD SPECIFIC FILES TO THIS PROJECT:
=======================================
    acp shit
    adm/style shit
    .htaccess (for flat links - optional)
    menu-related html/css shit
    do a .gitignore or something to prevent myself from accidentally adding other files

**work on development in this repo, add it as "upstream" to ssuns-2011, and fetch/merge whenever a big update is made**
